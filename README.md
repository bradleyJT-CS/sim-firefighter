# 🔥 SIM Firefighter

**SIM Firefighter** is a wildfire simulation game developed as part of a senior capstone project at Oregon State University. Players take on the role of incident commanders tasked with allocating resources to suppress fires, protect communities, and manage environmental conditions in real time.

> ⚠️ This repository serves as a **project showcase and development summary**. The actual game project is managed in **Unreal Engine 5** via **Perforce**, so source code is not available here.
