# SIM Firefighter

**SIM Firefighter** is a wildfire simulation game developed as part of a senior capstone project at Oregon State University. Players take on the role of incident commanders tasked with allocating resources to suppress fires, protect communities, and manage environmental conditions in real time.

> This repository serves as a **project showcase and development summary**. The actual game project is managed in **Unreal Engine 5** via **Perforce**, so source code is not available here.

## Game Overview

- **Engine**: Unreal Engine 5  
- **Team Size**: 4  
- **My Role**: Environmental systems, visual effects, UI mockups, gameplay prototyping  
- **Tools Used**: UE5 Blueprints, Niagara VFX, Houdini Engine, Perforce

## My Contributions

### Visual Effects (Niagara)
- Designed and implemented dynamic fire, smoke, and ember effects using Niagara.
- Designed and implemented dynamic wind, leaves, and rain effects using Niagara.

### Blueprint Scripting
- Prototyped interactive fire behavior using UE5 Blueprints.
- Set up basic systems for terrain-driven fire spread and suppression interaction.

### Game Design
- Helped plan core gameplay systems: suppression mechanics, economy/resource balance, and win/loss conditions.

### UI & Presentation
- Created mockups and ideas for menu layout, minimap, and fire alert indicators.
- Contributed to shaping a clean and accessible player interface.
